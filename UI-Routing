HOW Does UI-ROUTING WORK?
----------------------------

http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router.state.$state
$state: 
• service is responsible for representing states as well as transitioning between them. 
• It also provides interfaces to ask for current state or even states you're coming from.

Uses:
$state.go('contact.detail') - will go to the contact.detail state
$state.go('^') - will go to a parent state
$state.go('^.sibling') - will go to a sibling state
$state.go('.child.grandchild') - will go to grandchild state


CONTROLLER Example
var app = angular.module('app', ['ui.router']);
 
app.controller('ctrl', function ($scope, $state) {
  $scope.changeState = function () {
    $state.go('contact.detail');
  };
});
